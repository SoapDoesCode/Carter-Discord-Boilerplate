# DEPRECATION WARNING!
This code and API as a whole do not work as of September 1st, 2023, as CarterLabs have removed their API, rendering the code in this repository useless. This repository now remains as an archive **only**!

If you wish to use an AI language model from an API or an AI language model in general, it is recommended for you to either use the API my friends over at EurekaAI (Join their Discord [here](https://discord.gg/MBbt5mujPM)); or even better, wait until we, BubbleByte Development, release an API for our own custom Large Language Model! (Join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/rPMccVS6GH))

This is a modified version of TheMechanic57's Carter-Discord-Boilerplate, I have added support for using a ```.env``` file.

Link to Original: https://github.com/TheMechanic57/Carter-Discord-Boilerplate

Original ```README.md``` is below:

Carter API - Connect your Carter agent to your Discord bot!

This program is an extract from my own personal smart-home AI system, which uses both Carter and Sanware NLP to function.

This program allows you to connect your Discord bot to your Carter agent, enabling cross-platform communication.

You will need your Discord bot token and your Carter agent token to then insert into the .env file, you'll also need nextcord installed.

MIT License, feel free to do whatever you want with this. It's a simple program, but Carter is created by Huw Prosser, who did the real proper work in this! Go check it out! https://www.carterlabs.ai/

If there are any issues, please do feel free to tell me. I did program this while intensely drunk.

Developed by TheMechanic57 at Sanware Developments.
